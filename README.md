# Flashcards App — Spaced Repetition Learning System

A full-stack flashcards web application designed for efficient vocabulary learning using an interval-based spaced repetition algorithm.

The system automatically schedules card reviews based on user performance and stores the next review timestamp for each card in the database.

This project demonstrates:
- full-stack architecture
- REST API design
- JWT authentication
- interval scheduling logic
- deck-based content management
- multilingual UI
